# CI-CD-Pipeline
# 1. CI/CD -💡 Goal: Faster, automated, reliable software delivery with minimum manual work.
## CI (Continuous Integration):
- Developers push code → code is automatically tested, built, and integrated with main branch.
- CI → build + test automation.

## CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):
- After CI passes → code is automatically deployed to a server (staging/production).
- CD → deploy automation.

# 2. Workflow
**Workflow →** *YAM*L file that defines CI/CD logic in GitHub Actions.
## 1. Developer Code Commit → Git Repo (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
## 2. CI Pipeline:
- Checkout code
- Install dependencies
- Linting & Testing
- Build artifact (e.g., Docker image)
- Store in registry
## 3. CD Pipeline:
- Deploy to staging
- Run integration tests
- (Optional) Approval step
- Deploy to production
## 4. Monitor & Rollback if failure.

# 3. Example Flow
Developer → Git Push → CI (Test + Build + Docker Image) → Push to Registry → CD (Deploy to Staging → Prod) → Monitoring → Rollback if needed.

# 4. Tools
- Version Control: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- Artifacts Repositories: DockerHub, Nexus, AWS ECR, JFrog Artifactory
- Infra/Deploy: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, AWS/GCP/Azure
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog

# 5. Key Concepts
```
# 1. Workflow
Automated process defined in .github/workflows/ folder.
Written in YAML.

# 2. Job
A set of steps that run on the same machine.
Example: build → test → deploy.

# 3.Step
An individual task inside a job.
Can run commands (like npm install) or use prebuilt Actions.

# 4. Runner
The server where jobs run.
GitHub provides free runners (Linux, Windows, macOS). You can also self-host.

# 5.Action
A reusable piece of code that performs a task (e.g., checkout code, setup Node, deploy).
```
# 1. GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions is an automation platform built into GitHub.
- Whenever something happens in my repo, do this set of tasks automatically.
## 1. Workflow in GitHub Actions
A workflow is an automation pipeline you define in a `.yml` file inside:
`.github/workflows/`
## 2. Example Workflows
## 🟢 Example 1: CI (Test on Every Push) 
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`
```
name: CI Pipeline

on: 
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```
## 🔎 What happens here:
- Runs whenever someone pushes or creates PR to main.
- Checks out repo → installs dependencies → runs tests.
   
## 🟢 Example 2: CD (Deploy to AWS EC2 After CI) 
`.github/workflows/cd.yml`
```
name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to EC2
        run: |
          ssh -i ${{ secrets.AWS_KEY }} ec2-user@your-server-ip "
          cd /var/www/myapp &&
          git pull origin main &&
          systemctl restart myapp"
```
## 🔎 Here:
- On push to main, it SSHs into your server.
- Pulls latest code.
- Restarts app service.
  
## 🟢 Example 3: CI/CD Workflow (Combined)
`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
```
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: npx vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```
🔎 Here:
- Job 1: build-test → runs tests.
- Job 2: deploy → runs only if build-test passes.
- Deploys to Vercel automatically.

## 3. 🚀 Benefits of GitHub Actions
- Integrated with GitHub (no extra setup).
- Supports Linux, Windows, macOS.
- Free usage (2,000–3,000 minutes/month).
- Marketplace with 10,000+ ready-made actions.

# 2. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
Jenkins is a self-hosted automation server. You install Jenkins on your server/VM.

## Pipeline Steps
- 1.Developer pushes code to GitHub.
- 2.Jenkins (via webhook) detects new push.
- 3.Jenkins pipeline executes stages:-
-  -Checkout repo
-  -Install dependencies
-  -Run tests
-  -Build artifact (JAR/Docker image)
-  -Push artifact to registry
-  -Deploy to server/Kubernetes
Example (Jenkinsfile)
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest'
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build & Push') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t myapp:latest .'
                sh 'docker push mydockerhub/myapp:latest'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sshagent(['server-ssh']) {
                    sh 'ssh user@server "docker pull mydockerhub/myapp:latest && docker run -d -p 8000:8000 myapp:latest"'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
✅ More customizable, best for enterprise-scale projects.

| Setup         | Easy, YAML-based          | Complex, needs Jenkins setup/plugins                |
| Cost          | Free (limited minutes)    | Free, but needs infra                               |
| Scalability   | Limited to GitHub runners | Very scalable (distributed agents)                  |
| Integration   | Native with GitHub        | Works with any VCS (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, SVN) |
| Best Use Case | Small/medium projects     | Large/enterprise projects                           |
